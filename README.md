React project developed by [Fillipe Eduardo Oliveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fillipe-eduardo-oliveira/)

We had to develop a _iTunes_-style React application using the React Router library and fetching music data from the Apple Music's API.

### Note

This project is still under development. I am implementing the layout, and I will refactor the code. I haven't deployed the application yet.
